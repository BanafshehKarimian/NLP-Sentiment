November 15, 2006    DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died same battery problem   this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't.  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year   it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last twice! cause otherwise I'd be a fan August 12, 2006    got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it  100 good thing i could return it November 3, 2006    The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy October 24, 2006    We have had ours for almost a year   it still works great, but there is one big problem   the display is a white/violet bright light.  Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room!  My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it.  We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio November 13, 2006    This Amazon listing also suggests buying the Soundsticks along with Airport Express. If you're thinking of connecting them to the USB port of Express, Apple says it won't work. Apple Airport Express FAQs October 15, 2004    This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100 240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1 2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that November 15, 2006    This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it.  But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3 6 months.  In my case, it was 3 months.  It just doesn't turn on anymore.  I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead.  I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model.  This one has problems.  I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not.  And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days.  April 19, 2006    I found that these DVD Rs did not work well in my system, were unreliable and slow.  I cannot recommend them November 3, 2006    I purchased this wireless card based on the price, figuring that even if it didn't live up to the good reviews here, I would only be out ~$20.  The set up was easy and smooth, but the card won't stay connected to my wireless network.  I've got a Belkin wireless router.  The Trendnet signal meter generally shows ~95% signal strength, but the connection only lasts for a few minutes, and I have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access  very annoying.  I know there's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop's connection is stable.  I purchased a D Link card, and it has worked flawlessly.  Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging when the Trendnet card arrived; if I hadn't, then this card would be on its way back to Amazon now.  Like the title of my review says: you get what you pay for . . .  August 31, 2006    I purchased this device to add to my wireless network, which uses a Belkin wireless router.  I had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router.  After configuring it, I could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router.  I made three attempts at customer service   my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes, the second call was working with a woman in India, who's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent.  I had to end that session because we couldn't hear each other.  I then used online chat, and after 90 minutes I still had not solved my problem, and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons.  The lady from India did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem, and now I believe her November 21, 2006    This player worked for 2 months. Then all of sudden it started failing with "no disk" message. Please do not go for cheap players November 16, 2006    The Voice recorder meets all my expectations and more Easy to use, easy to transfer great results September 7, 2006    I had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.  So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation i.e: without batteries but the cable is so thin, it is not recommended to protect any valubles October 22, 2006    I SO wanted to love this thing. I have an iPod that I am seldom without, and my car isn't iPod compatible. I bought a Monster Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger so I could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion. Unfortunately, the thing just didn't work for me.   There are 8 preset stations low on the dial and if all of them are in use, you're out of luck. I don't live in a huge city maybe 60,000 with farmland all around, but only two of these stations were available. Although I was able to tune in to my iPod, it wasn't crystal clear. In fact, it wasn't even plastic clear. The static sometimes overrode the music, which drove me nuts. This is like a fax machine   the original may be spotless, but the fax will be a little fuzzy.   If you have a cassette player in your car, there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better. If your car isn't iPod compatible and you don't have a cassette player, you're better off just burning a bunch of CD's July 16, 2006    I HATE DESE KIND OF PHONES. DAY HAVE EM AT MI SKOOL N DA R TURRBLE. THEY HAV OK SOUND BUT DAY FEEL TURRBLE LIK PUTTIN TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON UR EARS. THEY F  KING HURT DOG. DON'T GET DESE, GET SONY H.EAR DOSE R ALWAYZ DA BEST November 4, 2006    Wiring broke at interface box   poor design October 8, 2005    During the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server, the installation program froze my PC completely. I had to turn off the PC, and now it does nothing when I turn it on. The lights on the front light up, but nothing happens at all. I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server perhaps there are some, but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration.   I went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, emphasis his that his software could have caused these symptoms.   Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system. He declined that offer.  So, at the end of the day, I'm left with a dead PC, but, according to Netgear, a perfectly good wireless card and installation CD.   No more Netgear for me, thank you! October 2, 2006    I just purchased this printer last night at BestBuy and took it home. When I removed the contents of the box, I noticed that the USB cord was not in there. I read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately. I couldn't believe it. So, I went to the store and bought one. This cost me an additional $11. I went home, installed the software and plugged everything in. I printed off a few things and it looked great. Today, I went to use the printer again and the power woudn't turn on! I disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power! I tried several more things and still couldn't turn the power on. Now I have to return it to BestBuy. This was the first and last time I will ever buy anything from HP!! October 18, 2006    On the good side, it was easy to set up, and worked reasonably well if the phone tried both cordless and corded was plugged directly into unit. However, I could not get it to work on other phones in the house when I used the jack to plug it into the wall per the instructions so it would work like a land line on any phone in the house. I do not have a land line, so it may just need a land line to work since you are supposed to be able to switch back and forth. I even tried disconnecting the line outside the house but that didn't work either.   I experience sporatic dropped calls that were not present before installing this device. I contacted tech support and was sent a driver upgrade v 1.20 not available from their website. This seemed to improve the dropped call situation a bit, but I still have more dropped calls than before.   The dealbreaker for me was after I found out you had to be logged in as an administrator for it to work. With an "always on" internet connection, I was not willing to expose myself to that security risk November 16, 2006    The Antenna did not work at all! Save your money! August 21, 2006    My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic   it really comes up with a great plan. However   my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand   but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much   but at least it works. Come on Tomtom   get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions October 29, 2005    After only a couple of months of light use, the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working.  As soon as power is connected to the sub woofer, the loud thumping starts.  I exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks!!  A total piece of junk July 29, 2006    Problem #1   out of hte box, these units are assigned 192.168.0.10 as an IP address.  find if your network is on the .0 subnet.  So I had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured. Problem #2   once changed, now i have Ip address issues because of the existing clients picking up the .10 address. Problem #3   If you incorrectly specificy the SSID/wep key or IP address, you have to put it back to the defaults and start over.  there's no way to configure the unit  Problem #4   it just plain don't work as it should.  Easily the most difficult unit i've ever had to configure.  It's a shame that I'm swearing off linksys as their prices are good.  Despite it's decent price, stay away from this one March 14, 2006    when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was angry.i tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a hassle.i decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was bad.the only thing i could have done is to buy a new adapter.so i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to work.i was furious October 22, 2006    Gave it one star because there was no option for zero. Died after two days of use, would not turn on or reset. Previous Zen Nano, same thing after six months of use. I guess that would be my last Creative product April 10, 2006    Camera will not stay up on wireless network with Dlink router! Firmware has some serious issues. Dlink support was worthless. I returned the camera and bought a Panasonic and never looked back November 26, 2005    Yesterday was the annual Thanksgiving sale day. I got this 1G CF card from Staples by $40 after easy rebate. With this price, I think it is a great deal. However, it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was DEAD. All my photos in the card were lost. I am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering, I know how to recover data if a hard drive fails. But this time, I find I simply can't help. Fortunately, Staples have a good return policy and I just returned it without hassle. Hopefully, this is only my case. My suggestion: make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item.  January 10, 2002    Sorry, the speakers don't attach well, and the quality of these stands is not what I'm used to with a Bose system February 11, 2003    One of the two ends was broken September 4, 2004    Buy the "empty" player for 37, then get a 128 mb card....its only 5 bucks mopre total..... November 6, 2006    The item I bought had to be returned due to the fact it did not wor March 19, 2005    The long cord simply didn't work. I returned it to Maxell, using the address on the back of the package, and had the product returned to me because the facility has closed. I've spent almost $5 trying to return an $8 product. May 7, 2004    The photo on the Target website shows a cable input/output for cable protection. The unit arrived with a phone line input/output not much help for those expecting protection on their cable line August 20, 2006    I was disappointed with these earphones. The sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated.  The $30 Sony MDR EX51 earphones I already owned sounded much better August 18, 2006    I had bought this item due to good review before I went to a trip to Bulgaria. However, it plugs in but doesn't work. Why? I don't know. how should I deal with it now?  Is it a defect one? I have no idea, to me I just lost 17 dollars for an experience. don't buy electronic items from a book store, even it's cheaper Fortunate I also bought Targus travel adaptor set that save me August 8, 2003    I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke.. June 14, 2006    I love the functionality of this armband. The problem is that it keeps breaking. The place at which the band loops through the holder keeps breaking.. I'm on my second one and it is almost ready for another replacement.. December 27, 2005    It dies if you plug in any external USB disk drive or card reader.  D Link just doesn't know how to write device drivers that work well.  I've had problems with every D Link product I've ever bought November 10, 2006    I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets one Kodak and one these Energizers when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.  After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them. June 9, 2006    I adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought.  I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.  The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage. July 31, 2006    I bought this unit on a wim.  I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS.  I really like it and it worked well for me.  Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery.  So I returned it for another one.  It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem.  Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units.  When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up.  Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for.  So I called customer service and got an RAN.  I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems November 5, 2006    I bought Magellan RoadMate 700 Vehicle GPS 2 months back and its not working as expected. its very poor in locating the the place and sometimes don't even work. Many times this sytem got hung and power off and on again is the solution to get it work again.  Might this product is very good in market, but I got the bad piece August 22, 2005    I am in the process of looking to return.  The seal is not so good, so you have to run it through the machine a couple of times.  In addition, the lamination has ridges in it.  It isn't a smoothe finish and it isn't air pockets?? November 9, 2006    I received the iPod quickly which was a plus. But it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs. I had friends who have the same iPod try to fix it and it never worked. I sent it back and requested a refund. It has been a month and a half and I have YET to get my $120 back. October 13, 2006    When I plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes, then the speaker's internal power simply cut off. Happened on the AC adapter or batteries, whether I was using my computer or my iPod as the sound source. Same behavior every time.   Logitech sent me a replacement from a new production run, same thing happened. Sent it back to Logitech on my nickel, got another replacement from same production run Product ID: A612. Same problem.  After two months and many long waits for Logitech tech support, I'm giving up. Maybe it was just a bad run, or maybe my environment is flukey, but I'm sorry I ever bought this thing September 18, 2006    I just bought a new RatpadzGS to replace my four year old ratpadz. Compaired to the old Ratpad, the RatpadzGS is made with a lower density Cheap Otm plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech G7 mouse. When using the mouse on the GS it causes the curser to sort of stutter along. Overall I would pass on this product, for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad. August 17, 2006    I recently purchased this item from Amazon. What I received was version 2 of this modem. The current version on the Linksys site is version 4. As a Cox customer, the results of my purchase were unsatisfactory. I will be returning this and purchasing the version 4 Linksys from another vendor June 11, 2006    This set lost color and picture quality over the few months that I owned it and then it just stopped working.  I'm going to buy something else and so should you September 25, 2006    I've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them.  I still love them now....  when they work.  The problem is that the cord is shoddy.  When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working.  I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work.  If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all.  I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.  I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.  Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit December 28, 2004    You can't plug two of these in side by side, the plastic surrounding the business ends are too fat May 4, 2005    I was terribly disappointed in this product which I bought for use in my Canon Pixma iP6000D printer. The image is grainy and, if you touch the photo within 5 minutes, you will leave marks. I laid anothe picture on top of one done 5 minutes earlier, and they stuck together. I have had very good luck with Canon paper May 17, 2005    Finally.    Next time I can't find my keys in the dark all I need to do is find this thingie and fumble it into my iPod's holes.  What a lifesaver!  And in the same box is the laser pointer so I don't have to stop listening to 50cent just because I'm doing some silly corporate presentation!    While it is a little tough to dance and fry an airline pilot's eyes at the same time, it is the latest craze so I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  ;  November 9, 2006    This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera but the Fuji and Sandisk product did November 16, 2005    I loved this speaker system when I got it last year.  But in the last few months it developed a loud humming noise that makes it so you can not hear your music.  Very disapointed November 2, 2006    Does NOT work with my Creative ZEN.  Can leave plugged in overnight and it does NOT charge at all November 9, 2006    ANTonline sent me the wrong item and then wanted nothing to do with me when I went to exchange it. They have no phone number, so they email everything. It takes them a day to get back to you and they always have an air about them as if you are bothering them for thier mistake. After days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me, they agreed to take the product back, but I had to eat the first shipping charge, pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20% restocking fee for thier error!! The item was only like $10, so by the time I would have paid the shipping and restock fees, I would be in the whole, so I decided to just tell them to go F@#K themselves. I feel better now. December 11, 2005    I've had my HP5510 for 4 weeks. So far everything works to my expectations except  when I press the scan button an error comes up on the LED: Unable to scan documents from Printer to PC. No Scan Options. You need to install or run HP software for feature. Press OK to continue." My system is 4 weeks old. I had a local reputable company put my system together. We uninstalled and installed HP software several times. Went to HP website could not find a patch. Couldn't repair error. My last resort is to call HP which I haven't yet.   August 18, 2006    Broken after 3 uses.  Extremely flimsy.  Spend a few more buck and buy something more substantial.   August 8, 2006    This receiver doesn't work in rural areas.  It doesn't work as well as a cheap battery powered fm radio October 8, 2005    I like the phone's simplicity and ergonomics. It's fatal flaw is the lack of range. My office is about 50ft away from the base, and I get unacceptable interference. Both plain old AT&T & GE 900 handle this distance without any problems March 23, 2005    This flash drive does not work with Windows 98SE. The back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for Windows 98SE at the maufacturer's web site. First I tried downloading the driver. Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver. After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC. The FAQ at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled. But the FAQ doesn't tell you how to enable the BIOS February 8, 2006    I have had two of these units.  I would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ML 300.  Save yourself some money and get something else.  Both of the units lasted only 14 months.  I did hardly any typing with them. Only multi page forms and applications.  The printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys.  Took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing.  Contacted Brother International USA and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months.  Save yourself some money and buy a Big Chief table and a number 2 pencil.  October 26, 2006    Got this antenna from my wife for my birthday; to go with my Roadmate 760 I just purchased.. The antenna we received was the AT 65 antenna. Instead of the large round antenna in the picture it was a small rectangular antenna 1 inch x 1 1/2 inch with no indication that it was an actual Magellan antenna, on the unit itself. The package had a Magellan cardboard insert but this was definitely not the antenna pictured August 6, 2006    I purchased the Zen Nano four months ago.  It was working then total system failure.  At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help.  The screen would flash on and then off.  It will not boot up.  Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed.  It goes in the trash.  In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored.  Also, the output volumn was to low.  I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task.  Now it is landfill May 20, 2006    I knew I had to pay shipping for this cards $5 so I decided to buy 4 at once, what was my surprise that at checkout they wanted to charge me five dollars shipping for each card eventhough they were going to be ship together I decided not to buy them anymore. They lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1% but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35% more than anywhere else. Its a shame that they try to rip you off that way. BUY THEM AT THE APPLE STORE ON LINE, NO SHIPPING FEE !!!!!!!! YOU PAY ONLY FACE VALUE NOT A CENT MOR July 19, 2006    This item said that it is compatible with all ipods but it is not.  It is only compatible with the "old" ipods.  Evidently there is a difference in some of the more recent ipods and this itrip doesn't work with them.  We had to return the product October 7, 2006    The first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product.  Its REALLY cheap looking.  Looks like something you'd find for ...] at a flea market or in the "stocking stuffers" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit.  This looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit. Certainly not a ...] accessory. It just cheapens the Apple image.  If OEM Apple products are your thing, then go ahead and try this. But if you're looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout, look for something else.  I'm returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere. June 14, 2006    Stay away from Vonage!  After more than 1 month, still don't have phone number transferred.  Can't get thru to customer service...very long wait.  Paying 2 phone bills...so much for saving cost and so called service.  Called to cancel service, and customer service rep promised to put account/billing on hold until phone number transfer is done...finally something positive from customer service department August 28, 2006    Ordered it, took about 5 days to get to me, and it's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it October 22, 2005    It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered they glow a bright blue. August 23, 2006    Memorex DVDR's are the best. Price keeps dropping and never have a problem July 8, 2006    A memory Stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a Sony Camera   Fantastic March 29, 2006    My setup:   Dell Latitude PP01L Intel chip   Win XP Pro   D Link DI 624 Wireless Router with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna   Enabled the WEP feature  I unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its Plug n Play thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn't 'see' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.  The CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up to date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D Link card. I've never had a problem with D Link's website or customer service, while we're on the subject, so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D Link's site.    Either way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.  Be sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information.  I've had no problems with my current set up.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up to date August 16, 2005    Fantastic, take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality November 10, 2006    A lot of space    My computer is over 5yrs old so I use these CD's as a  great back up for storing all my old documents, my ebooks, and my pics. August 25, 2006    Great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo November 3, 2006    the product arrive to me in very good condition, will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd February 24, 2006    I use my USB hub every day and it works fine with every device I plug into it November 6, 2006    MY HUSBAND & I SEARCHED & SEARCHED FOR DVD'S THAT WERE COMPATABLE TO OUR DVD RECORDED.  NO ONE COULD HELP.  THEN I THOUGHT, "I'LL JUST CHECK ON AMAZON," AND SURE ENOUGH THERE THEY WERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT A RELIEF!!!!!!!!!!  I WOULD HATE TO OWN A DVD RECORDER & NOT BE ABLE TO RECORD ANYTHING!!!!!  THANK YOU!!! March 2, 2006    I would have given it a five star but sense it's the only one I have ever used I had nothing to compare with. I have used it nine tines and it worked perfect every time. Sturdily made.   November 9, 2006    I bought this phone to replace my older Panasonic because I needed a new answering machine.  I love that I can retrieve messages from the handset.  The handset is a bit smaller than earlier models, but just took some getting used to.  Would definitely recommend February 24, 2006    A good stuff at great price and as usual Amazon was fast to send the item October 31, 2006    I was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great. It has good reception and I like the size of it. This phone is just what I was looking for. March 29, 2006    I totally recommend this mouse. I purchased the 1st mouse a few months about and just now bought another one for my other laptop.  I like it that you have an assortment of colors you can chose from also. The battery life is pretty good also July 3, 2006    Very easy to use. Expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level. No external power required. Highly recomend it. October 25, 2006    Kingston's 2GB Data Traveler USB drive is perfect to storage files. I have looked for a 2 GB USB and found this one to be the cheapest based on its characteristices. I think it is a bargain price January 15, 2006    There isn't too much to write about this except is delivers as stated.  Great product for the price November 10, 2006    It has very good definition but is slow, even in the night is not that good and is slower November 11, 2006    The system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an in home office which had a single network connection. Haven't measured simultaneous throughput to multiple computers yet, but from simple observation connectivity seems transparent. Should allow for movement to gigabit switching in the future as well July 3, 2006    ...for a surge protector.  But as far as I can tell, it's doing its job.  Plus it looks kind of neat November 11, 2006    e'nuf said   Epson always leads the way with printers and papers.  You can't go wrong!!!  Order was filled exactly as requested, and arrived in better than expected time.  The packaging was excellent.  I'll be back for more soon August 27, 2006    I got this phone about 1 month ago and I like all the features of the phone,Volume control ,Caller ID,Large display window and you can add up to 10 more hand set August 9, 2006    This mouse works perfectly fast and easy without problems even if you don't install the software. If you need a cordless mouse this is what you have to bu August 5, 2006    I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse.  Another nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control November 9, 2006    very good, worth the money. If you want a louder one, go for Z 535 January 29, 2006    work fine with my hp pavillion zd7050. increase the performance of my laptop November 9, 2006    I am happy with my purchase.  I only bought it because I don't like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones.  I would not use this product to entertain at a party, but it serves my needs December 31, 2005    For the most part, I do find HP ink to be the best.  However, every now and then a new ink cartridge is bad. One of the colors doesn't print for some reason.  My opinion is that these ink cartridges are just too expensive to be getting any bad ones October 28, 2006    Great cable that works as advertised.  Why spend $80 on a name brand cable which performs no better or no worse.  Connected a third gen Mot 6412 DVR with HD to a Sony 36XBR800. Great picture.  A name brand cable will not transmit your digital signal 6' any better than this Cables Unlimited brand will November 2, 2006    This bag is fantastic,comfortable to carry, fits loads in,protects my laptop,doubles as hand luggage.No complaints at all. Best bag I've ever bought August 12, 2006    If you go through a lot of AAA batteries, this is one of the best deals on the market, short of investing in a recharging unit and a couple of rechargeable batteries. A very good value March 17, 2006    The case itself fits very snug around the IPOD, and even gives it a better look.  The only complaint that I have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open, and even falls off at times.  I still give the case a 4 star rating, because I am a soldier in Iraq, and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean.  If a product can keep something clean in Iraq, then I am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere.  October 29, 2006    I purchased my iTrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product.  The iTrip is a good choice over competitors' products and offers a good value for the money.  Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.    Overall, good product, good value for the money, and if carefully handled, will last a long time.  March 15, 2006    Review this product over the internet, and it is just what I was looking for my daughter of twelve years of age, pros. is portable and rechargable; cons. the sound is not as good as the Boose but with less volume it is quite acceptabl August 16, 2006    This was a defective unit. Got new unit and it works as expected July 31, 2002    These mini CD Rs work great in our Sony Mavica CD Cameras at a cost of only .42 cents apiece August 27, 2006    Product was as described...reception was strong and weak depending on your location...was able to receive all frequencies..rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy...could get annoying on a very windy day..radio is bulky and heavy.. January 29, 2006    If money was no object, I would prefer the totally wireless headset phone, however, this has been a great alternative.  I have TMJ, and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck, while holding my toddler, while preparing dinner, compound my pain...go figure!  I find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain, but, the product works great.  I have had no problems hearing anyone, nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me.  The earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off, even for someone with elfishly small ears like me!  May 22, 2006    I was unsure at first if this product would work with my iPod nano, but after checking out Griffin's website, I decided to go ahead and order it.  It works great!  I like to play Solitaire and read text files on my nano, so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if I didn't use the screen so much.  TuneJuice means I don't ever have to worry about that again.  I just keep a couple of 9V batteries with me, and I can keep listening, playing, reading or whatever on my nano as long as I want.  Love it.         I posted the above review on May 22, 2006 after having had the TuneJuice for almost 3 weeks.  Two of those weeks were spent on vacation and this little gadget got a lot of use.    Now, about 5 months after first receiving the TuneJuice, I'm about to order my second one   to replace the first one.  I still love it, and did get a lot of use out of it, but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps' that connect to the battery itself to break off. Despite that, I feel like I got my money's worth and I'm buying another one March 25, 2005    This remote will do everything you need or want. Simple to use and great customer service. I had a couple of "glitches" buttons that didn't work quite right when I first programmed the device, but the Harmony support team helped me through those areas. The changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the Harmony web site so if I ever need to, all I have to do is reload the info.  Like another reviewer, I also have a TiVO 2 actually and the only button that wouldn't work on my Harmony 680 was the "clear" button. Customer service fixed that in a jiffy, too.  I have owned several multiple device remotes over the years and never had one so good that I could really put away all my other remotes. I now only use one   the Harmony 680. Fantastic device! I'd give it 6 stars if I could March 22, 2006    This is great!  My only problem is the knob for adjusting. It's to loose November 5, 2006    This does what it's advertized too.  I like not having wires.  The iPod in my bag, and just the headset.  It would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset, ie turn off the headset, receiver and ipod all from the headset.  Instead, I have to get the ipod back out, turn it off, turn the receiver off, then turn the headset off.  Otherwise, the sound is good and the headset hasn't broken for me yet July 10, 2006    This was by far the easiest computer peripheral I have ever setup! Works flawlessly with my Netgear wireless router June 28, 2006    This is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality March 20, 2006    I am amazed by the quality of the guitar. The product is extremely good. The service by amazon was ultimate. Thanks a lot Amazon November 12, 2006    Unit's range shorter than expected, but I feel that I got what I wanted, and paid for. Shipping and delivery were great October 12, 2006    Esactly what I was wanting.  When you turn there is resistance springs I think and everything works great.  If you use flight sims you need this product.  Works awsome November 9, 2006    I love it.  You can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
